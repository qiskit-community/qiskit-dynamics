**This repo is still in the early stages of development, there will be breaking API changes**

Qiskit Dynamics is an open-source project for building, transforming, and solving
time-dependent quantum systems in Qiskit.

The goal of Qiskit Dynamics is to provide access to different numerical
methods, and to automate common processes typically performed by hand,
e.g. entering rotating frames, or doing the rotating wave approximation.

Qiskit Dynamics can be configured to use either
[NumPy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) or [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax)
as the backend for array operations. [NumPy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) is the default,  
and [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) is an optional dependency.
[JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) provides just-in-time compilation, automatic differentiation,
and GPU execution, and therefore is well-suited to tasks involving repeated
evaluation of functions with different parameters; E.g. simulating a model of a quantum system
over a range of parameter values, or optimizing the parameters of control sequence.

## Installation

Qiskit Dynamics may be installed using pip via:

```
pip install qiskit-dynamics
```

Additionally, Qiskit Dynamics may be installed simultaneously with the CPU version of
JAX via:

```
pip install "qiskit-dynamics[jax]"
```

which is equivalent to

```
pip install "jax[cpu]"
pip install qiskit-dynamics
```
