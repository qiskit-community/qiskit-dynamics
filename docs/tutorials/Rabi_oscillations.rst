Simulating Rabi oscillations with noise and decoherence
=======================================================

In this tutorial we walk through an example of solving using
``qiskit_dynamics`` the time evolution of a qubit being driven close to
resonance. The model that we solve consists of a single qubit perturbed
by a sinusoidal drive. In addition, will consider energy relaxation and
decoherence terms modeled by using a Lindblad master equation.

In the sections below we define a model, solve the dynamics and plot the
qubit oscillations using the following steps:

1. Define all relevant parameters and setup a ``Solver`` instance with the Hamiltonian model of
   the system.
2. Define the initial state and simulation times, and evolve the system state.
3. Plot the qubit state as a function of time and discuss the results.
4. Solve again the the model with jump operators for the Lindblad dissipator, and plot the results.

In the first step below, we model the time evolution of a qubit’s state
taken as a two-level system, using the Schrödinger equation with a
Hamiltonian containing a diagonal term of frequency :math:`\nu_z` and a
transverse term of amplitude :math:`\nu_x` and harmonic driving
frequency :math:`\nu_d`,

.. math:: H = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \pi \nu_z {Z} + 2 \pi \nu_x \cos(2 \pi \nu_d t){X},

where :math:`\{X,Y,Z\}` are the Pauli matrices (also written as
:math:`\sigma^a` with :math:`a\in\{x,y,z\}`).

1. Setup the solver with the Hamiltonian model
----------------------------------------------

In the following, we will set :math:`\hbar=1` and fix some arbitrary
time units, with all frequency parameters scaled accordingly. Below, we
first set a few values for these frequency parameters, and then setp the
``Solver`` class instance that stores and manipulates the model to be
solved, using matrices and ``Signal`` instances. For the
time-independent :math:`z` term we set the signal to a constant, while
for the trasverse driving term we setup a harmonic signal.

.. jupyter-execute::
    :hide-code:

    import warnings
    warnings.filterwarnings('ignore', message='', category=Warning, module='', lineno=0, append=False)


.. jupyter-execute::

    import numpy as np
    from qiskit.quantum_info import Operator
    from qiskit_dynamics import Solver, Signal


    nu_z = 10.
    nu_x = 1.
    nu_d = 9.98  # Almost on resonance with the Hamiltonian's energy levels difference, nu_z

    X = Operator.from_label('X')
    Y = Operator.from_label('Y')
    Z = Operator.from_label('Z')
    s_p = 0.5 * (X + 1j * Y)

    solver = Solver(static_hamiltonian=.5 * 2 * np.pi * nu_z * Z,
                    hamiltonian_operators = [2 * np.pi * nu_x * X],
                    hamiltonian_signals = [Signal(envelope=1., carrier_freq=nu_d)])

2. Solve the system
-------------------

We now define the initial state for the simulation, the time span to
simulate for, and the intermediate times for which the solution is
requested, and solve the evolution.

.. jupyter-execute::

    from qiskit.quantum_info.states import Statevector
    from qiskit.quantum_info import DensityMatrix

    t_final = .5 / nu_x
    tau = .005

    y0 = Statevector([1., 0.])

    n_steps = int(np.ceil(t_final / tau)) + 1
    t_eval = np.linspace(0., t_final, n_steps)

    sol = solver.solve(t_span = [0., t_final], y0 = y0, t_eval = t_eval)

3. Plot the qubit state
-----------------------

Below we define a local function that calculates the qubit’s Pauli
expectation values as a function of time (which define also the Bloch
vector),

.. math:: \langle X(t)\rangle, \langle Y(t)\rangle, \langle Z(t)\rangle.

The same function plots both these three curves, and the Bloch vector at
the final time, depicted in 3D on the Bloch sphere. We will reuse this
function in the next section.

We see that for the parameters we have defined, the qubit has completed
almost exactly a :math:`\pi`-rotation of the qubit Bloch vector about
the :math:`x` axis, from the ground to the excited state (with many
intermediate rotations of its transverse component, whose amplitude
increases and decreases). This mechanism of Rabi oscillations is the
basis for the single-qubit gates used to manipulate quantum devices - in
particular this is a realization of the :math:`X` gate.

.. jupyter-execute::

    from qiskit.visualization import plot_bloch_vector
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    %matplotlib inline

    fontsize = 16

    def plot_qubit_dynamics(sol, t_eval, X, Y, Z):
        n_times = len(sol.y)
        x_data = np.zeros((n_times,))
        y_data = np.zeros((n_times,))
        z_data = np.zeros((n_times,))

        for t_i, sol_t in enumerate(sol.y):
            x_data[t_i] = sol_t.expectation_value(X).real
            y_data[t_i] = sol_t.expectation_value(Y).real
            z_data[t_i] = sol_t.expectation_value(Z).real

        _, ax = plt.subplots(figsize = (10, 6))
        plt.rcParams.update({'font.size': fontsize})
        plt.plot(t_eval, x_data, label = '$\\langle X \\rangle$')
        plt.plot(t_eval, y_data, label = '$\\langle Y \\rangle$')
        plt.plot(t_eval, z_data, label = '$\\langle Z \\rangle$')
        plt.legend(fontsize = fontsize)
        ax.set_xlabel('$t$', fontsize = fontsize)
        ax.set_title('Bloch vector vs. $t$', fontsize = fontsize)
        plt.show()

        display(plot_bloch_vector([x_data[-1], y_data[-1], z_data[-1]],
                                  f'Bloch vector at $t = {t_eval[-1]}$'))

    plot_qubit_dynamics(sol, t_eval, X, Y, Z)

4. Redefine the model with damping and decoherence.
---------------------------------------------------

Now we add to our simulation an environment modeled as a memory-less
(Markovian) bath, solving the Lindblad master equation with the same
Hamiltonian as before, but accounting also for energy relaxation and
decoherence terms. We simulate the dynamics to times longer than the
typical relaxation times :math:`T_1=1/\Gamma_1` and
:math:`T_{\phi}=1/\Gamma_2`. The qubit’s state has to be described using
a density matrix, now evolving according to the Lindblad master
equation,

.. math:: \partial_t\rho = -\frac{i}{\hbar} \left[H,\rho\right] + \mathcal{D}[\rho].

We take the Lindblad dissipator to consist of two terms,

.. math:: \mathcal{D}[\rho] = \mathcal{D}_1[\rho] + \mathcal{D}_2[\rho].

The action of energy relaxation terms describing damping into the
environment with rate :math:`\Gamma_1` are generated by

.. math:: \mathcal{D}_1[\rho] = \Gamma_1\left(\sigma^+ \rho\sigma^- - \frac{1}{2} \{\sigma^- \sigma^+,\rho\}\right),

with :math:`\sigma^{\pm}= \frac{1}{2}\left(X\pm i Y\right)`.

The second dissipator describes (“pure”) dephasing with rate
:math:`\Gamma_2`, and reads

.. math:: \mathcal{D}_2[\rho] = \Gamma_2\left(Z \rho Z - \rho\right).

We use the function defined above for calculating the Bloch vector
components, which can be done since in ``qiskit`` and in
``qiskit-dynamics`` the syntax of many functions is identical for both
state vectors and density matrices. The shrinking of the qubit’s state
within the Bloch sphere due to the incoherent evolution can be clearly
seen in the plots below.

.. jupyter-execute::

    Gamma_1 = .8
    Gamma_2 = .2

    t_final = 5.5 / max(Gamma_1, Gamma_2)

    y0 = DensityMatrix.from_label('0')
    solver = Solver(static_hamiltonian=.5 * 2 * np.pi * nu_z * Z,
                    hamiltonian_operators=[.5 * 2 * np.pi * nu_x * X],
                    hamiltonian_signals = [Signal(envelope=1.,
                                                  carrier_freq=nu_d)],
                    static_dissipators = [np.sqrt(Gamma_1) * s_p, np.sqrt(Gamma_2) * Z])

    n_steps = int(np.ceil(t_final / tau)) + 1
    t_eval = np.linspace(0., t_final, n_steps)

    sol = solver.solve(t_span = [0., t_final], y0 = y0, t_eval = t_eval)

    plot_qubit_dynamics(sol, t_eval, X, Y, Z)
