How-to use different array libraries and types with Qiskit Dynamics
===================================================================

The simulations and computations in Qiskit Dynamics can be executed with different array libraries
and types. A user can choose to use either NumPy or JAX to define their models, and the code in
Qiskit Dynamics will execute as if the array operations had been natively written in either library.
Additionally, a user can specify that the operators in a model be stored in sparse types offered by
SciPy or JAX (see :ref:`configuring simulations for performance <configuring simulations>`).
Internally, Qiskit Dynamics utilizes `Arraylias <https://qiskit-community.github.io/arraylias/>`_
to dispatch computations on different array types to the appropriate library function.

This guide addresses the following topics:

1. Example: How-to use either NumPy or JAX when building a :class:`.Signal`.
2. How-to use the Qiskit Dynamics NumPy and SciPy aliased libraries.
3. How-to write JAX-transformable simulations.


1. Example: How-to use either NumPy or JAX when building a :class:`.Signal`
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

First, configure JAX and import array libraries.

.. plot::
    :context:
    :include-source:

    # configure jax to use 64 bit mode
    import jax
    jax.config.update("jax_enable_x64", True)

    # tell JAX we are using CPU
    jax.config.update('jax_platform_name', 'cpu')

    import numpy as np
    import jax.numpy as jnp


Defining equivalent :class:`.Signal` instances, with envelope implemented in either NumPy or JAX.

.. plot::
    :context:
    :include-source:

    from qiskit_dynamics import Signal

    def envelope_numpy(t):
        return np.exp(-(t - 0.5)**2 / 0.025)
    
    def envelope_jax(t):
        return jnp.exp(-(t - 0.5)**2 / 0.025)
    
    signal_numpy = Signal(envelope=envelope_numpy)
    signal_jax = Signal(envelope=envelope_jax)


Evaluation of ``signal_numpy`` is executed with NumPy:

.. plot::
    :context:
    :include-source:

    type(signal_numpy(0.1))

Evaluation of ``signal_jax`` is executed with JAX:

.. plot::
    :context:
    :include-source:

    type(signal_jax(0.1))

JAX transformations can be applied to ``signal_jax``, e.g. just-in-time compilation:

.. plot::
    :context:
    :include-source:

    from jax import jit

    jit_signal_jax = jit(signal_jax)
    jit_signal_jax(0.1)


2. How-to use the Qiskit Dynamics NumPy and SciPy aliased libraries
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Internally, Qiskit Dynamics uses an extension of the default NumPy and SciPy array libraries offered
by `Arraylias <https://qiskit-community.github.io/arraylias/>`_. These can be imported as:

.. plot::
    :context:
    :include-source:
    
    # alias for NumPy and corresponding aliased library
    from qiskit_dynamics import DYNAMICS_NUMPY_ALIAS
    from qiskit_dynamics import DYNAMICS_NUMPY

    # alias for SciPy and corresponding aliased library
    from qiskit_dynamics import DYNAMICS_SCIPY_ALIAS
    from qiskit_dynamics import DYNAMICS_SCIPY

See the `Arraylias documentation <https://qiskit-community.github.io/arraylias/>`_ for how the
general library aliasing framework works, as well as the Qiskit Dynamics submodule :mod:`.arraylias`
for a description of how the default NumPy and SciPy aliases have been extended for use in this
package.

3. How-to write JAX-transformable simulations
---------------------------------------------

One of the primary benefits of JAX is its function transformations; e.g. just-in-time compilation,
and automatic differentiation. To make use of these transformations in Qiskit Dynamics simulations,
a user needs to ensure that the user-supplied code is itself JAX-transformable (e.g. the
:class:`.Signal` envelope defined above), and that they use a JAX-based solver.

Here, we walk through an example of building a :class:`.Solver`, and JAX-compiling a simulation that
scans over a control parameter.

First, we construct a :class:`.Solver` instance with a simple qubit model.

.. plot::
    :context:
    :include-source:

    import numpy as np
    from qiskit.quantum_info import Operator
    from qiskit_dynamics import Solver, Signal

    r = 0.5
    w = 1.
    X = Operator.from_label('X')
    Z = Operator.from_label('Z')

    static_hamiltonian = 2 * np.pi * w * Z/2
    hamiltonian_operators = [2 * np.pi * r * X/2]

    solver = Solver(
        static_hamiltonian=static_hamiltonian,
        hamiltonian_operators=hamiltonian_operators,
        rotating_frame=static_hamiltonian
    )


Next, define the function to be compiled:

  - The input is the amplitude of a constant-envelope signal on resonance, driven over time
    :math:`[0, 3]`.
  - The output is the state of the system, starting in the ground state, at ``100`` points over the
    total evolution time.

.. plot::
    :context:
    :include-source:

    def sim_function(amp):

        # define a signal with constant envelope, on resonance
        signals = [Signal(amp, carrier_freq=w)]

        # run the simulation
        results = solver.solve(
            t_span=[0, 3.],
            y0=np.array([0., 1.], dtype=complex),
            signals=signals,
            t_eval=np.linspace(0, 3., 100),
            method='jax_odeint'
        )

        return results.y

Compile the function.

.. plot::
    :context:
    :include-source:

    from jax import jit
    fast_sim = jit(sim_function)

The first time the function is called, JAX will compile an `XLA <https://www.tensorflow.org/xla>`__
version of the function, which is then executed. Hence, the time taken on the first call *includes*
compilation time.

.. plot::
    :context:
    :include-source:

    start_time = time.time()

    ys = fast_sim(1.).block_until_ready()

    print(f"Run time: {time.time() - start_time}")


On subsequent calls the compiled function is directly executed, demonstrating the true speed of the
compiled function.

.. plot::
    :context:
    :include-source:

    start_time = time.time()
    
    fast_sim(1.).block_until_ready()

    print(f"Run time: {time.time() - start_time}")


We use this function to plot the :math:`Z` expectation value over a range of input amplitudes.

.. plot::
    :context:
    :include-source:

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    for amp in np.linspace(0, 1, 10):
        ys = fast_sim(amp)
        plt.plot(np.linspace(0, 3., 100), np.real(np.abs(ys[:, 0])**2-np.abs(ys[:, 1])**2))
