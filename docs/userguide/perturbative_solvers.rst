How-to use Dyson and Magnus based solvers
=========================================

.. warning::

    This is an advanced topic --- utilizing perturbation-theory based solvers
    requires detailed knowledge of the structure of the differential equations
    involved, as well as manual tuning of the solver parameters.
    See the :class:`.DysonSolver` and :class:`.MagnusSolver` documentation for API details.
    Also, see :footcite:`puzzuoli_sensitivity_2022` for a detailed explanation of the solvers,
    which varies and builds on the core idea introduced in :footcite:`shillito_fast_2020`.

.. note::

    The circumstances under which perturbative solvers outperform
    traditional solvers, and which parameter sets to use, is nuanced.
    Perturbative solvers executed with JAX are setup to use more parallelization within a
    single solver run than typical solvers, and thus it is circumstance-specific whether
    the trade-off between speed of a single run and resource consumption is advantageous.
    Due to the parallelized nature, the comparison of execution times demonstrated in this
    userguide are highly hardware-dependent.


In this tutorial we walk through how to use perturbation-theory based solvers. For
information on how these solvers work, see the :class:`.DysonSolver` and :class:`.MagnusSolver`
class documentation, as well as the perturbative expansion background information provided in
:ref:`Time-dependent perturbation theory and multi-variable
series expansions review <perturbation review>`.

We use a simple transmon model:

.. math:: H(t) = 2 \pi \nu N + \pi \alpha N(N-I) + s(t) \times 2 \pi r (a + a^\dagger)

where:

-  :math:`N`, :math:`a`, and :math:`a^\dagger` are, respectively, the
   number, annihilation, and creation operators.
-  :math:`\nu` is the qubit frequency and :math:`r` is the drive
   strength.
-  :math:`s(t)` is the drive signal, which we will take to be on
   resonance with envelope :math:`f(t) = A \frac{4t (T - t)}{T^2}`
   for a given amplitude :math:`A` and total time :math:`T`.

We will walk through the following steps:

1. Configure ``qiskit-dynamics`` to work with JAX.
2. Construct the model.
3. How-to construct and simulate using the Dyson-based perturbative solver.
4. Simulate using a traditional ODE solver, comparing speed.
5. How-to construct and simulate using the Magnus-based perturbative solver.

1. Configure to use JAX
-----------------------

These simulations will be done with JAX array backend to enable
compilation. See the :ref:`userguide on using JAX <how-to use jax>` for a more detailed
explanation of how to work with JAX in Qiskit Dynamics.

.. jupyter-execute::

    from qiskit_dynamics.array import Array

    # configure jax to use 64 bit mode
    import jax
    jax.config.update("jax_enable_x64", True)

    # tell JAX we are using CPU if using a system without a GPU
    jax.config.update('jax_platform_name', 'cpu')

    # set default backend
    Array.set_default_backend('jax')

2. Construct the model
----------------------

First, we construct the model described in the introduction. We use a relatively
high dimension for the oscillator system state space to accentuate the speed
difference between the perturbative solvers and the traditional ODE solver. The higher
dimensionality introduces higher frequencies into the model, which will
slow down both the ODE solver and the initial construction of the perturbative solver. However
after the initial construction, the higher frequencies in the model have no impact
on the perturbative solver speed.

.. jupyter-execute::

    import numpy as np

    dim = 10  # Oscillator dimension

    v = 5.  # Transmon frequency in GHz
    anharm = -0.33  # Transmon anharmonicity in GHz
    r = 0.02  # Transmon drive coupling in GHz

    # Construct cavity operators
    a = np.diag(np.sqrt(np.arange(1, dim)), 1)
    adag = np.diag(np.sqrt(np.arange(1, dim)), -1)
    N = np.diag(np.arange(dim))

    # Static part of Hamiltonian
    static_hamiltonian = 2 * np.pi * v * N + np.pi * anharm * N * (N - np.eye(dim))
    # Drive term of Hamiltonian
    drive_hamiltonian = 2 * np.pi * r * (a + adag)

    # total simulation time
    T = 1. / r

    # Drive envelope function
    envelope_func = lambda t: t * (T - t) / (T**2 / 4)

3. How-to construct and simulate using the Dyson-based perturbative solver
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Setting up a :class:`.DysonSolver` requires more setup than the standard
:class:`.Solver`, as the user must specify several configuration parameters,
along with the structure of the differential equation:

- The :class:`.DysonSolver` requires direct specification of the LMDE to the
  solver. If we are simulating the Schrodinger equation, we need to
  multiply the Hamiltonian terms by ``-1j`` when describing the LMDE operators.
- The :class:`.DysonSolver` is a fixed step solver, with the step size
  being fixed at instantiation. This step size must be chosen in conjunction
  with the ``expansion_order`` to ensure that a suitable accuracy is attained.
- Over each fixed time-step the :class:`.DysonSolver` solves by computing a
  truncated perturbative expansion.

  - To compute the truncated perturbative expansion, the signal envelopes are
    approximated as a linear combination of Chebyshev polynomials.
  - The order of the Chebyshev approximations, along with central carrier frequencies
    for defining the “envelope” of each :class:`.Signal`, must be provided at instantiation.

See the :class:`.DysonSolver` API docs for more details.

For our example Hamiltonian we configure the :class:`.DysonSolver` as follows:

.. jupyter-execute::

    %%time

    from qiskit_dynamics import DysonSolver

    dt = 0.1
    dyson_solver = DysonSolver(
        operators=[-1j * drive_hamiltonian],
        rotating_frame=-1j * static_hamiltonian,
        dt=dt,
        carrier_freqs=[v],
        chebyshev_orders=[1],
        expansion_order=7,
        integration_method='jax_odeint',
        atol=1e-12,
        rtol=1e-12
    )

The above parameters are chosen so that the :class:`.DysonSolver` is fast and produces
high accuracy solutions (measured and confirmed after the fact). The relatively large
step size ``dt = 0.1`` is chosen for speed: the larger the step size, the fewer steps required.
To ensure high accuracy given the large step size, we choose a high expansion order,
and utilize a linear envelope approximation scheme by setting the ``chebyshev_order`` to ``1``
for the single drive signal.

Similar to the :class:`.Solver` interface, the :meth:`.DysonSolver.solve` method can be
called to simulate the system for a given list of signals, initial state, start time,
and number of time steps of length ``dt``.

To properly compare the speed of :class:`.DysonSolver` to a traditional ODE solver,
we write JAX-compilable functions wrapping each that, given an amplitude value,
returns the final unitary over the interval ``[0, (T // dt) * dt]`` for an on-resonance
drive with envelope shape given by ``envelope_func`` above. Running compiled versions of
these functions gives a sense of the speeds attainable by these solvers.

.. jupyter-execute::

    from qiskit_dynamics import Signal
    from jax import jit

    # Jit the function to improve performance for repeated calls
    @jit
    def dyson_sim(amp):
        """For a given envelope amplitude, simulate the final unitary using the
        Dyson solver.
        """
        drive_signal = Signal(lambda t: amp * envelope_func(t), carrier_freq=v)
        return dyson_solver.solve(
            signals=[drive_signal],
            y0=np.eye(dim, dtype=complex),
            t0=0.,
            n_steps=int(T // dt)
        ).y[-1]

First run includes compile time.

.. jupyter-execute::

    %time yf_dyson = dyson_sim(1.).block_until_ready()


Once JIT compilation has been performance we can benchmark the performance of the
JIT-compiled solver:

.. jupyter-execute::

    %time yf_dyson = dyson_sim(1.).block_until_ready()


4. Comparison to traditional ODE solver
---------------------------------------

We now construct the same simulation using a standard solver to compare
accuracy and simulation speed.

.. jupyter-execute::

    from qiskit_dynamics import Solver

    solver = Solver(
        static_hamiltonian=static_hamiltonian,
        hamiltonian_operators=[drive_hamiltonian],
        rotating_frame=static_hamiltonian
    )

    # specify tolerance as an argument to run the simulation at different tolerances
    def ode_sim(amp, tol):
        drive_signal = Signal(lambda t: amp * envelope_func(t), carrier_freq=v)
        res = solver.solve(
            t_span=[0., int(T // dt) * dt],
            y0=np.eye(dim, dtype=complex),
            signals=[drive_signal],
            method='jax_odeint',
            atol=tol,
            rtol=tol
        )
        return res.y[-1]

Simulate with low tolerance for comparison to high accuracy solution.

.. jupyter-execute::

    yf_low_tol = ode_sim(1., 1e-13)
    np.linalg.norm(yf_low_tol - yf_dyson)


For speed comparison, compile at a tolerance with similar accuracy.

.. jupyter-execute::

    jit_ode_sim = jit(lambda amp: ode_sim(amp, 1e-8))

    %time yf_ode = jit_ode_sim(1.).block_until_ready()

Measure compiled time.

.. jupyter-execute::

    %time yf_ode = jit_ode_sim(1.).block_until_ready()


Confirm similar accuracy solution.

.. jupyter-execute::

    np.linalg.norm(yf_low_tol - yf_ode)

Here we see that, once compiled, the Dyson-based solver has a
significant speed advantage over the traditional solver, at the expense
of the initial compilation time and the technical aspect of using the solver.

5. How-to construct and simulate using the Magnus-based perturbation solver
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Next, we repeat our example using the Magnus-based perturbative solver.
Setup of the :class:`.MagnusSolver` is similar to the :class:`.DysonSolver`,
but it uses the Magnus expansion and matrix exponentiation to simulate over
each fixed time step.

.. jupyter-execute::

    %%time

    from qiskit_dynamics import MagnusSolver

    dt = 0.1
    magnus_solver = MagnusSolver(
        operators=[-1j * drive_hamiltonian],
        rotating_frame=-1j * static_hamiltonian,
        dt=dt,
        carrier_freqs=[v],
        chebyshev_orders=[1],
        expansion_order=3,
        integration_method='jax_odeint',
        atol=1e-12,
        rtol=1e-12
    )


Setup simulation function.

.. jupyter-execute::

    @jit
    def magnus_sim(amp):
        drive_signal = Signal(lambda t: Array(amp) * envelope_func(t), carrier_freq=v)
        return magnus_solver.solve(
            signals=[drive_signal],
            y0=np.eye(dim, dtype=complex),
            t0=0.,
            n_steps=int(T // dt)
        ).y[-1]


First run includes compile time.

.. jupyter-execute::

    %time yf_magnus = magnus_sim(1.).block_until_ready()

Second run demonstrates speed of the simulation.

.. jupyter-execute::

    %time yf_magnus = magnus_sim(1.).block_until_ready()


.. jupyter-execute::

    np.linalg.norm(yf_magnus - yf_low_tol)


Observe comparable accuracy at a lower order in the expansion, albeit
with a modest speed up as compared to the Dyson-based solver.
