prelude: >
    Replace this text with content to appear at the top of the section for this
    release. All of the prelude content is merged together and then rendered
    separately from the items listed in other parts of the file, so the text
    needs to be worded so that both the prelude and the other items make sense
    when read independently. This may mean repeating some details. Not every
    release note requires a prelude. Usually only notes describing major
    features or adding release theme details should have a prelude.
features:
  - |
    Adds JAX sparse evaluation mode to models and
    :class:`qiskit_dynamics.Solver`.
    This mode can be enabled by setting the ``evaluation_mode`` to
    ``'sparse'`` while :meth:`~qiskit_dynamics.array.Array.default_backend` is set to ``'jax'``
    This evaluation mode is only recommended for use on CPU unless
    the arrays are extremely sparse.
  - |
    Adds additional fixed-step solvers implemented with JAX. New solvers are
    ``'jax_RK4'``, available through :func:`qiskit_dynamics.solve_ode`
    and parallelized solvers ``'jax_RK4_parallel'`` and ``'jax_expm_parallel'`` available
    via :func:`qiskit_dynamics.solve_lmde`. The parallelized solvers
    are only recommended for use with GPU.
  - |
    Adds new :class:`~qiskit_dynamics.array.Array` class methods
    :meth:`~qiskit_dynamics.array.Array.default_backend`,
    :meth:`~qiskit_dynamics.array.Array.set_default_backend`,
    :meth:`~qiskit_dynamics.array.Array.available_backends` which implement
    the functionality of the previous methods of the same name from the
    dispatch module.
upgrade:
  - |
    The :class:`~qiskit_dynamics.array.Array` class and
    :func:`~qiskit_dynamics.array.wrap` function have been moved from the
    :mod:`qiskit_dynamics.dispatch` module to a separate
    :mod:`qiskit_dynamics.array` module to separate the ``Array`` class
    from the underlying dispatch system it uses internally.
deprecations:
  - |
    The :func:`qiskit_dynamics.dispatch.default_backend` function has been
    deprecated and will be removed in 0.3.0 release. It has been replaced by
    the :meth:`qiskit_dynamics.array.Array.default_backend` class method.
  - |
    The :func:`qiskit_dynamics.dispatch.set_default_backend` function has been
    deprecated and will be removed in 0.3.0 release. It has been replaced by
    the :meth:`qiskit_dynamics.array.Array.set_default_backend` class method.
  - |
    The :func:`qiskit_dynamics.dispatch.available_backends` function has been
    deprecatedand will be removed in 0.3.0 release. It has been replaced by
    the :meth:`qiskit_dynamics.array.Array.available_backends` class method.
  - |
    The :func:`qiskit_dynamics.dispatch.backend_types` function has been
    deprecated as it is no longer needed.
  - |
    Importing the :class:`~qiskit_dynamics.array.Array` class for the
    :mod:`qiskit_dynamics.dispatch` module has been deprecated. It should now
    be imported from the :mod:`qiskit_dynamics.array` module instead.
  - |
    Importing the :class:`~qiskit_dynamics.array.wrap` function for the
    :mod:`qiskit_dynamics.dispatch` module has been deprecated. It should now
    be imported from the :mod:`qiskit_dynamics.array` module instead.
