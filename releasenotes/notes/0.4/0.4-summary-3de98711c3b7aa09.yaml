    This release primarily focuses on tooling for simulating `Qiskit Pulse
    <https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/pulse>`__ schedules. The major changes related to
    this are:
      - This release adds the :class:`.DynamicsBackend` class, which provides a
        :class:`~qiskit.providers.BackendV2` interface for running simulations. Once constructed and
        configured, the :meth:`.DynamicsBackend.run` method can be used to simulate schedules or
        circuits at the pulse level, returning measurement results in the same way as a real
        backend. See the new :ref:`Simulating backends at the pulse-level with DynamicsBackend
        <dynamics backend>` tutorial for how to set up the class for different applications.
      - This release modifies the schedule to signal converter :class:`.InstructionToSignals` to
        enable JAX transforms of simulations of pulse schedules built using
        :class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.ScalableSymbolicPulse`. See the user guide entry on the
        technicalities and limitiations of utilizing :ref:`JAX-compatible pulse schedules <how-to
        use pulse schedules for jax-jit>`, as well as the :ref:`tutorial on control sequence
        optimization <optimization tutorial>`, which has been updated to include a section on
        gradient optimization of pulse schedules. This functionality requires ``qiskit-terra``
        0.23.0, which is now the minimum required version.
    
    As of this release, Qiskit Dynamics now supports Python 3.11, and has dropped support of Python
    3.7. Additionally, higher-order versions of existing matrix-exponential solvers have been added,
    and some arguments and methods that were deprecated in version 0.3 have been removed.

features:
  - |
    Adds Python 3.11 support.
  - |
    Adds new class :class:`.DynamicsBackend`, which provides a
    :class:`~qiskit.providers.backend.BackendV2` interface for running simulations with Qiskit
    Dynamics. This class can either be instantiated with a :class:`.Solver` instance configured for
    Pulse simulation, or through the :meth:`.DynamicsBackend.from_backend`, which builds an instance
    using the Hamiltonian description provided in an IBM backend.
  - |
    Adds the ``magnus_order`` argument to exponential based solvers ``"scipy_expm"`` and
    ``"jax_expm"``. Accepts values in ``[1, 2, 3]`` corresponding, respectively, to the 2nd, 4th,
    and 6th order methods described in Section 5.4 of :footcite:`blanes_magnus_2009`.
  - |
    The logic of :class:`.InstructionToSignals` has been updated to be JAX-compatible when
    converting pulse schedules containing only :class:`.ScalableSymbolicPulse` pulses. See the new
    user guide entry :ref:`JAX-compatible pulse schedules <how-to use pulse schedules for jax-jit>`
    for details.
issues:
  - |
    JAX release 0.4.4 modified the internals of ``jit`` compilation, resulting in errors when
    attempting to automatically differentiate and compile calls to :func:`.solve_lmde_perturbation`.
    This is a bug in JAX, and is discussed in `this discussion thread
    <https://github.com/google/jax/discussions/14561>`__. Until this is fixed, if using this
    functionality, JAX can be reverted to the old mode of compilation by executing the following
    code before importing JAX:

    .. code-block:: python

      import os
      os.environ["JAX_JIT_PJIT_API_MERGE"] = "0"
upgrade:
  - |
    Starting with this release, Python 3.7 is no longer supported.
  - |
    The minimum ``qiskit-terra`` version has been increased to 0.23.0.
  - |
    The deprecated ``list`` formatting for the ``carriers`` argument to
    :class:`.InstructionToSignals` is no longer supported. All code utilizing this argument must be
    converted to the dictionary input format.
  - |
    The deprecated :class:`.Solver` init arguments ``hamiltonian_signals`` and
    ``dissipator_signals`` have been removed. Signals in the model can now only be passed to the
    :meth:`.Solver.solve` method.
  - |
    The deprecated ``Solver.signals`` property has been removed. The model stored in a
    :class:`.Solver` instance no longer stores signals.
  - |
    The deprecated :meth:`.Solver.copy` method has been removed. There is no replacement for this
    functionality; the new intended mode of operation for :class:`.Solver` is to be immutable, and
    hence there is no longer any need to create copies.
fixes:
  - |
    :class:`.InstructionToSignals` has been updated to fix issues with phase accumulation resulting
    from :class:`~qiskit.pulse.instructions.SetFrequency` and
    :class:`~qiskit.pulse.instructions.ShiftFrequency` instructions. A phase accumulation term has
    been added so that the digitized carrier frequency is continuous across these instructions. A
    related phase error when generating samples for channels subject to
    :class:`~qiskit.pulse.instructions.SetFrequency` and
    :class:`~qiskit.pulse.instructions.ShiftFrequency` instructions has also been fixed. (`#140
    <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-dynamics/issues/140>`__)
  - |
    :class:`.InstructionToSignals` has been updated to fix an error when parsing schedules that
    include barrier instructions. `#202 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-dynamics/issues/202>`__)
  - |
    Fixes a bug in the automatic jit-compilation of :meth:`Solver.solve` when using the ``t_eval``
    kwarg with a JAX method and ``Array.default_backend() == 'jax'``. The bug is fixed by updating
    the time-argument handling for the ``"jax_odeint"`` and Diffrax methods. The automatic jitting
    is now disabled for all other JAX methods. (`#122
    <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-dynamics/issues/122>`__ and `#175
    <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-dynamics/issues/175>`__)
  - |
    The ``jax.Array`` class has been added to the dispatcher for compatibility with JAX 0.4.
    (`#162 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-dynamics/issues/162>`__)
  - |
    Validation checks have been added to the :class:`.DysonSolver` and :class:`.MagnusSolver`
    classes to ensure that the ``operators``, ``carrier_freqs``, and ``chebyshev_orders`` arguments
    have compatible shapes. This fixes bugs in the behaviour of these classes when implicit
    assumptions about array shapes were violated. (`#160
    <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-dynamics/issues/160>`__)
