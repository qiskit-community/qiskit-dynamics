    New method ``'lanczos_diag'`` has been added to solver methods. This is an approximate
    lmde method that diagonalises a smaller subspace (the Krylov Subspace). The advantage is
    a speedup. The size of this subspace ``k_dim``, controls the accuracy of this algorithm 
    at the cose of runtime. To use this method, an addtional kwarg ``k_dim`` must be suplied 
    to ``solve``.
