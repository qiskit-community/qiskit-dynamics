    `DynamicsBackend.solve()` method can now work without specifying a t_span argument. 
    The default t_span is set to be [0, solve_input.duration] for each provided solve_input.
    This allows users to solve the dynamics of a quantum circuit without having to specify its
    duration in advance.
