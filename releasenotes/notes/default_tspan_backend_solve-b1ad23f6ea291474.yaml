    ``DynamicsBackend.solve()`` method can now work without specifying a ``t_span`` argument. 
    The default ``t_span`` is set to be ``[0, solve_input.duration]`` for each provided ``solve_input``.
    This allows users to solve the dynamics of a quantum circuit without having to specify its
    duration in advance.
