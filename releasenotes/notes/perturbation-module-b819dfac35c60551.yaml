prelude: >
    Adds perturbation theory sub module for computing and utilizing the Dyson series
    and Magnus expansion in a multi-variable setting.
features:
  - |
    Adds :class:`.ArrayPolynomial` for representing multi-variable array-valued polynomials.
  - |
    Adds function :func:`.solve_lmde_perturbation` for computing Dyson series and Magnus
    expansion terms for solutions to linear matrix differential equations.
  - |
    Adds data container class :class:`.PerturbationResults` for storing and accessing the
    results of :func:`.solve_lmde_perturbation`.
  - |
    Adds classes :class:`.DysonSolver` and :class:`.MagnusSolver` implementing perturbation
    expansion-based fixed-step solvers for linear matrix differential equations.
other:
  - |
    Adds ``multiset`` package as a dependency.
