    To enable compatibility with QuTiP 5.0.0, ``qutip.Qobj`` instances are now converted to a raw
    array type in Dynamics via the ``qutip.Qobj.full`` method. This method always returns a dense
    array, and hence ``qutip.Qobj`` instances are no longer turned into ``scipy.sparse.csr_matrix``
    instances in Dynamics.
